An example of using the `virtual-module-webpack-plugin` with webpack 2
that demonstrates it can work in a production environment with
the `extract-text-webpack-plugin` and loaders such as the
`json-loader` and `css-loader` with source maps.

Run `npm install` and then `npm start` or `npm run build` to try it out.
The `npm start` script uses webpack-dev-server and you can view
